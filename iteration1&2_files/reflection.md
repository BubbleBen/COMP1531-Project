Reflection

The first meeting took place on the 29th of September, 2019. From 10:00AM till 11:15. All members were present. 

We began by brainstorming strategies to complete this iteration as efficiently as possible. The iteration with its 32 functions and 4 files awaiting completion seemed daunting. However, the task began to seem more achievable as we broke down the iteration and divided the work amongst ourselves. We decided to allocate the tasks according to each member?s strengths and past experiences. For example, Ben volunteered to complete the user stories as he had enjoyed doing them for the lab exercise last week. Every member was allocated 8 functions (out of 32) and a file to complete. 

Files: 
1. User Stories (Kenny)
2. Assumptions (Ben)
3. Plan (Jeff)
4. Reflection (Emad) 

Functions: 
1. Jeff: From auth_login to channel_messages
2. Emad: From channel_leave to message_sendlater
3. Kenny: From message_send to user_profile
4. Ben: From user_profile_setname to admin_userpermission_change

As we value the benefits of collaboration, we planned when next to meet to exchange ideas on the work we will complete. Here arose our first instance of disagreement. Although we had liked to meet in-person, this would be impossible given the work commitments of some members. Going back and forth, we settled on completing the files on Google Docs and then, every member would read and provide feedback in their own time. In addition to this, we agreed to exchange our ideas through Discord along with the existing group chat. This approach allowed us to function collaboratively despite our misaligned schedules. 

In summary, the outcomes of this meeting includes the allocation of tasks, an outline of our approach towards this project and a basis for collaboration. 

As we near the end of iteration 1, our experiences allow us to reflect and identify areas of improvement. We have realised that although we divided the work, much of it was interlinked with each other. This meant that there were no strict divisions and instead, all members made significant contributions in each other?s work, especially for the assumptions section. An area of improvement that we have identified is that we need to get together, in-person, after everyone?s work has been completed to discuss and evaluate each other?s work. This form of in-house examination will help in identifying our shortcomings before submission and provide valuable insights. For this to happen, it is necessary that we complete our tasks sufficiently earlier than the deadline.
