With the tests roughly completed for each function in the agreed upon interface, the next step is to actually begin to implement the interface given by Sally and Bob. Clearly, with any type of design development, not every function will take the same ammount of time. For example, auth_logout would likely only require a few lines as it just needs to confirm the token is active, then invalidate and logout the user. However, the function standup_start, will require much more work than simple data manipulation. Furthermore, for each of the functions we implement, we will need to ensure we are aware of how and when to raise exceptions, and to have the appropriate responses occur when these exceptions are raised.

Going forward, it would likely be best to split the work evenly amongst members, and begin working on functions that do not rely on others. This means that functions that may need to call each other, will be left to later, as they will be difficult to test directly at the beginning. By completing the functions that are not calling others, we can create a few useful functions that can be called repeatedly, and by using these functions often, we may also finds bugs we may not have realised earlier on. This means functions like, auth_login, auth_logout, auth_register, channel_invite etc. It can also be seen that these functions can be called with tests to make the tests more succinct and more through as logging in and out users at different times could result in breaking the code, identifying potential bugs. This is also a good idea, as for most of the team members, coding in python is a new skill being developed. This means by completing the easier funcitons first, we will also obtain more experience and comfort with the language, creating a nice learning curve for each of us to follow. I believe some of the easier functions will likely take 20-30mins at most, and the harder functions will likely need to be worked on over multiple days, while getting help from other members.

When considering implementing these functions, it is easy to consider the work in isolation of frustration. Since we will be working on the more basic fucntions initially, we will be able to work through the assigned functions relatively easily. This likely means that a lot of the easy functions will be completed very quickly at the beginning giving a strong sense of progress, but this will very likely slow down which may affect motivation and morale. I believe however, this will not be an issue as since this is a group project, is a certain member cannot complete a certain function, we can consult each other, or potentially trade designated functions to try work on different code that may be easier for some members. Going forward, the most important aspect we must be focusing on is motivating each other and ensuring we are not isolating anyone, but ensuring everyone is up to date and being willing with giving help and advice.
