Rigidity- Incorporated more components to classes such that we edit classes and not add random things
Fragility- ???
Immobility- Changed to have a route handler isolated and then functions in different files, makes it easier to extract functions for us to use in different projects
Opacity- Convetion in variable names, and better variable names, comments and helper functions
Needless complexity- Removed a few for loops
