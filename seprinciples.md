# Software Engineering Principles
With our new knowledge of software engineering principles such as Dont Repeat Yourself (DRY), Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) and more, when we were required to refactor and add to our code, we made some extra changes to adhere to these to practice better software engineering methods. By practicing these methods we made our code 'smell less' meaning it was more rigid, less fragile, more mobile, and removed lots of needless complexity. For example, when we incorporated some more useful components to our class, such as permission flags or a list of channels the user is in, which made the code easier to change, as we did not need to read through all the code and change a few lines here and there. We also attempted to have uniform convention of variable names, function names and comments in order to increase readability, which was a major issue for us in iteration 2. One example of a minor fix we made, was changing all the class defintions to starting with a capital letter, as this made using the lower case version in for loops much less frustrating. However, the most significant change we made was the separation of our functions from our route handler, which was from what we saw assumed in iteration 2, but we had missed. This made our code much easier to read but more importantly test and use the code in different projects in the future. Overall the principles were adhered via the following ways:

## Dont Repeat Yourself (DRY)
By implementing more helper functions to have each function only have one purpose, and improving the current ones by removing some repetition (such as using our new flags in the user class), we minimised repetition and therefore had the code be more succinct. By doing this we also found that when another teamr member needed a certain helper function, if we checked the helper_functiosn.py file more often than not someone else had already wrote it, allowing us to reuse that code and lower the time taken to complete the project.

## Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)
Previously, in iteration 2, we as a team was using the uuid4 module to generate random numbers for each id, whether it was user_id or message_id etc. This was unrequired complexity that we are adding, and found it lead to errors with the numbers being too large when we try to search for a certain id. Therefore, instead we removed the use of this for ids, and instead just kept track of how many messages, channels or users there were, and used that tracked number as the ids. This is not an issue as overlaps will never occur, and even if a certain message is deleted, the counter keeps incrementing and not issues will occur.

## You Arent Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
Fortunately, this was one of the design principles that we as a group were adhering to without explictly knowing so. At no point did we start building lower level functions until we fully understood the specifications and the purpose of each function. We also always began writing the higher level function first. This not only lead to minimising waste of time (as we didnt write any code we didnt need) but also minimised frustration as by doing so, we never ran into an issue where once we began writing we realised too late the code was not meetings the requirements anymore. Furthermore, instead of using "from ____ import *" which imports all functions in that module into the file, we decided to list all the functions out one by one. This reduces chances of errors and we may have overlapping names, but also ensures we dont have any excess that we dont need.
